# Form_Validation_using_JS

This projects uses HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript to provide validation to form. 
Validation does following thing-
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
- Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this    is not an email"*
